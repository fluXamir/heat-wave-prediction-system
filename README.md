# 🌡️ Heat Wave Prediction System

## Overview  
A **web-based application** built with **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to forecast daily temperatures and visualize sky conditions across cities in **India**. This tool highlights temperature trends and is being developed to **predict heat waves** based on a temperature threshold.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 User Input  
Enter any Indian city (e.g., *Mumbai*, *Patna*) and choose the number of forecast days (1–5).

### 🌡️ Temperature Forecast  
Get daily temperature predictions displayed through interactive Plotly charts.

### 🌤️ Sky Condition Visualization  
View sky conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.) using dynamic visuals for each forecasted day.

### 🔥 Heat Wave Prediction *(Coming Soon)*  
Automatically detect and highlight **potential heat waves** when forecasted temperatures exceed a defined threshold (e.g., 35°C).  
> 🚧 *This feature is under development.*

### 📈 Interactive Visualizations  
Built with **Plotly** for a visually rich and intuitive experience.
